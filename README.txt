Group members:

Ross Carter:
Ross did a lot of the typing up for the othello assignment. Ross and I both worked on 
thinking through the heuristic function and the various algorithms we had to use, although
we ended up doing a lot of the code writing on his computer. Ross also did a lot of the testing
involved with the heuristic. 

Grant Messner:
I worked with Ross on thinking through a lot of the code that we wrote for this assignment.
In particular, I worked a lot on the minimax algorithm and coded up a "rough draft" version
of it, which Ross and I ended up editing later. I also wrote up the readme files for the week
2 assignment.

Strategy:
For the first part of the assignment, we implemented a simple heuristic and created a 
minimax algorithm. We then sort of ran out of time to complete a more complicated AI.
Our strategy is mind games.
